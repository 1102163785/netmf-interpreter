The Microsoft .NET Micro Framework SDK supports development of code, including device I/O, in the C# language using a subset of the .NET libraries, and is fully integrated with the Microsoft Visual Studio® development environment.\r\n### Projects\r\n* [.NET Micro Framework Interpreter](https://github.com/NETMF/netmf-interpreter)\r\n  * This repository contains the source code to the .NET Micro Framework interpreter engine, Base Class Libraries and the native code Platform and Hardware Abstraction Layers (PAL/HAL) v4.4 and later. (For v4.3 and earlier see the [.NET Micro Framework CodePlex site](http://netmf.codeplex.com) )\r\n\r\n### Releases\r\n* .NET Micro Framework v4.4\r\n  * [SDK v4.4](https://github.com/NETMF/netmf-interpreter/releases/tag/v4.4-RTW-20-Oct-2015)\r\n  * [Legacy Crypto Libs](https://github.com/NETMF/netmf-interpreter/releases/tag/NETMFCryptoLibraries) (For building porting the .NET Micro Framework to custom devices)\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: As of v4.4 of the framework (and the move to GitHub) the Porting Kit is no longer necessary so there isn't any porting kit release for V4.4 or later. If you wish to use the digital signature support in TinyBooter and MFDeploy, you will need the legacy Crypto Libs.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
