### Crypto libraries for .NET Micro Framework
The source of the crypto libraries owned by Microsoft is not available publicly due to Microsoft security policies regarding Cryptographic technology.
The available components are not checked into the public repository. Instead they are made available as a separate binary download of pre-compiled
libraries. Developers can link to the libraries provided without requiring the source or, if they so choose, can replace them with their own private,
but compatible source implementations if desired. The build support in  the .NET Micro Framework will automatically select the cryptographic stub libraries
if the binary libraries are not installed.
 
 The latest versions of the libraries are available on the [releases section of the .NET Micro Framework GitHub site](https://github.com/NETMF/netmf-interpreter/releases)
