# Introduction
This is the top level view of the documentation for porting and maintaining the .NET Micro framework.
This provides a classic table of contents view of the documentation for the runtime. As with any table
of contents not every detail is linked from here, rather this covers the top layers with linked topics
containing further details (and potentially their own table of contents to more details)

1. [Coding standards]()
2. [Architecture]() ( Overview of the architecture of the Micro Framework )
3. [Build System]() ( Guide to how the NETMF build system works )
4. [Porting .NET Micro Framework to new hardware]() ( guide to porting to new hardware )
5. [Book of the Runtime]() (Provides details on the internals of the runtime itself)
6. [Lexicon]() (Collection of common terms and definitions as used in the NETMF docs with links to related topics)
7. [What's new in this release](WhatsNew.md) (Provides info and links to details on what is new in this release)
